                <h1>Jordan Clayton</h1>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hi! My name is Jordan Clayton and I am an aspiring developer (heavy emphasis on aspiring) from Toronto, Canada. I am mostly self-taught, but am due to begin a BSc. in Computer Science this coming Fall at TMU (2022). My background and training are in Fine Art, and I have held an artistic practice for nearly a decade. I am fairly new to web and mobile development, but am eager to continue learning.</p>
                <p>My spare time is currently devoted to studying in preparation for the fall, but outside of class-work I love to play video games. I am also (slowly) working on a game prototype, which will hopefully be released before I expire.</p>
                <p>This is my first attempt at front-end development; brace for impact, the road is bumpy.</p>
                <h2>Project 0: Search</h2>
                <p>This project is my submission for CS50x's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It is a basic (but functional! I hope) front-end for Google Search Queries. To switch between Light and Dark mode, click the toggle in the upper right hand corner.</p>
